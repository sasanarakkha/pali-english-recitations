  <p class="pali-leader">〈 Thus have I heard&#160;〉</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Benares&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> by one who has gone forth into homelessness&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which is low&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> vulgar&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the way of worldlings&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> ignoble&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> unbeneficial&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and the pursuit of self-mortification&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which is painful&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> ignoble&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> unbeneficial</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Without veering towards either of these extremes&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Tathāgata has awakened to the middle way&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which gives rise to vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which gives rise to knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which leads to peace&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to direct knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to enlightenment&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to Nibbāna</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">And what&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata which gives rise to vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which gives rise to knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which leads to peace&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to direct knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to enlightenment&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to Nibbāna</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">It is this Noble Eightfold Path:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">That Is&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right View&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Intention&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Speech&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Action&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Livelihood&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Effort&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Mindfulness&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Concentration</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which gives rise to vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which gives rise to knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which leads to peace&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to direct knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to enlightenment&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> to Nibbāna</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Now this&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> ageing is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> illness is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> death is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> union with what is displeasing is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> separation from what is pleasing is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> not to get what one wants is suffering&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in brief&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Now this&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> accompanied by delight and lust&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> seeking delight here and there&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> that is&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> craving for sensual pleasures&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> craving for existence&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> craving for extermination</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Now this&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the giving up and relinquishing of it&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> freedom from it&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> nonreliance on it</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Now this&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: It is this Noble Eightfold Path</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">That Is&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right View&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Intention&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Speech&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Action&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Livelihood&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Effort&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Mindfulness&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Right Concentration</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This is the noble truth of suffering&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of suffering has been fully understood&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be abandoned&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been abandoned&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be realized&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to be developed&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed&#8217;: thus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in regard to things unheard before&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in me vision&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> wisdom&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> true knowledge&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and light</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">So long&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> bhikkhus&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purified in this way&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Māra&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and Brahmā&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> its devas and humans</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">But when my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified in this way&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> Māra&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and Brahmā&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> its devas and humans</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">This is what the Blessed One said. Elated&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed One&#8217;s statement</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">And while this discourse was being spoken&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the dust-free&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> stainless vision of the Dhamma:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;"><q>Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation</q></p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">And when the Wheel of the Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One,&#160;the earth-dwelling devas raised a cry:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Tāvatiṁsa devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the Tāvatiṁsa devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Yāma devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the Yāma devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Tusita devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the Tusita devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Nimmānaratī devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the Nimmānaratī devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the Paranimmitavasavattī devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Having heard the cry of the Paranimmitavasavattī devas&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the devas of Brahmā&#8217;s company raised a cry:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">"At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world"</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Thus at that moment&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> at that instant&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> at that second&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> the cry spread as far as the brahmā world&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and this ten thousandfold world system shook&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> quaked&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and trembled&#160;<span class="breathmark">’</span> and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devas</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:</p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;"><q>Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!</q></p>

  <p class="pali-hang" style="font-style: italic;">In this way the Venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name <q>Aññā Koṇḍañña—Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood</q></p>
